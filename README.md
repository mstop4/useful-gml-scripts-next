# Useful GML Scripts Next (WIP)

A collection of useful, reuseable GML script I've made over the years. **NOTE:** *These are not 100% production-ready.* They're here mainly for my personal projects, buy you are welcome to look around.

The scripts are divided into two categories:

## Standalone

A library of largely independent helper functions and structs that are easily integrated into any project.

## Components

A library of more complex prefabs.
