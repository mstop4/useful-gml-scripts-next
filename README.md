# Useful GML Scripts Next (WIP)

A collection of useful, reuseable GML script I've made over the years. This repository is a continuation of work done in the old [Useful GML Scripts](https://github.com/mstop4/useful-gml-scripts) repo, refactored to take as much advantage of the features in the latest GameMaker runtimes and Feather. **NOTE:** *These are not 100% production-ready.* They're here mainly for my personal projects, but you are welcome to look around.

The scripts are divided into two categories:

## Standalone

A library of largely independent helper functions and structs that are easily integrated into any project.

## Components

A library of more complex prefabs.
